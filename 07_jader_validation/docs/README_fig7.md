# Figure 7 – External validation in JADER (CNI + APA, molecule-level)

## Part 1: JADER cohort characteristics
We summarized case counts and demographic distributions for CNI and APA molecules
in the JADER dataset, and quantified DIKI disproportionality signals (ROR with 95% CI).

## Part 2: External validation
We applied the locked molecule-level logistic model trained in FAERS (Figure 5)
to JADER case-level features to assess transportability.
TTO variables were intentionally excluded in this version.

## Notes
- Drug name standardization in JADER may contain Japanese-brand variations.
  We therefore restrict analyses to a curated molecule dictionary per study question.
- All performance metrics are reported with imbalanced-outcome considerations (AUPRC).
