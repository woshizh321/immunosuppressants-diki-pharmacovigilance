# Figure 6 – Molecule-level Risk Portraits

## Objective
To translate molecule-level regression results into clinically interpretable
risk profiles across demographic and indication strata.

## Methods
Risk portraits were generated using the locked molecule-level logistic model
derived in Figure 5. No model refitting was performed.

## Interpretation
Cyclosporine consistently produced the highest predicted DIKI risk,
particularly among transplantation recipients, whereas MMF and azathioprine
showed substantially lower risk profiles.

## Notes
Absolute risk estimates depend on the assumed baseline risk and are intended
for comparative interpretation rather than individual-level prediction.
