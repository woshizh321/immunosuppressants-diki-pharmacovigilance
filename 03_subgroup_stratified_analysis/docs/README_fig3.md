# Figure 3 – Subgroup-stratified disproportionality analysis

## Objective
Evaluate whether DIKI signals vary across demographic, clinical,
and temporal subgroups.

## Subgroups analyzed
- Sex
- Age
- Region
- Indication
- Seriousness
- Time-to-onset (TTO)

## Methods
ROR, PRR, and chi-square statistics were computed within each subgroup,
using the same DIKI definition and exposure criteria as Figure 2.

## Notes
All subgroup analyses are descriptive and intended to assess
effect modification rather than causal interaction.
